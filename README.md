# Celestia (Reloaded)  
the bot that started my dev journey and gave me lots of fun memories, now rewritten from scratch and made open source!  
Celestia has been my most precious creation and its the reason why i started coding (in something other than web dev at least)  
following her big impact on my life it was only appropriate to revive her and make her code available to everyone in spirit of being FOSS
